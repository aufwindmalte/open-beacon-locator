### ODC Open Database License (ODbL)

#### Preamble

The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while maintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some jurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally, the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to act in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.

Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL together with another license for the contents, if the contents have a single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the contents have multiple sets of rights, Licensors should describe what rights govern what contents together in the individual record or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.

Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trade mark over the database name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License.

#### 1.0 Definitions

**"Collective Database"** – Means this Database in one or more collections with other independent databases or works, in any medium, that together comprise this Database as a separate and independent work in itself.

**"Convey"** – As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables a Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative Database.

**"Contents"** – The contents of this Database, which includes the information, independent works, or other material collected into the Database.

**"Database"** – A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the terms of this License.

**"Database Directive"** – Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended or succeeded.

**"Database Right"** – Means rights resulting from the Chapter III ("sui generis") rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed by member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilization of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4.

**"Derivative Database"** – Means a database based upon the Database, and includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any other alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the Contents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or Re-utilizing the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new Database.

**"Extraction"** – Means the permanent or temporary transfer of any of the Contents to another medium by any means or in any form.

**"License"** – Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights such as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.

**"Person"** – Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or incorporate.

**"Publicly"** – means to Persons other than You or under Your control by You or a Person under Your control.

**"Re-utilization"** – Means any form of making available to the public all or a substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by renting, by online or other forms of transmission.

**"Substantial"** – Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a combination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilization of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the Extraction or Re-utilization of a Substantial part of the Contents.

**"Use"** – As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright or Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and includes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing, publicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the Database, as well as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode or format.

**"You"** – Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Database, or who has received express written permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa.

#### 2.0 What this License covers

2.1. **Legal effect of this document.** This License is:

a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;

b. A license of the Database Right; and

c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.

2.2. **Legal rights covered.** This License covers the legal rights in the Database, including:

a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database. The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organization of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of Contents stored in the Database;

b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and Re-utilization of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents. Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would not infringe any applicable copyright; and

c. **Contract.** This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of use on this access as outlined in this License.

2.3. **Rights not covered.**

a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making or operation of the Database;

b. This License does not apply to Contents in the Database which are independent works that do not owe their existence to the Database. For clarity, this includes: documents, images, audiovisual material, and sounds included in the Database. Each of these independent works may have their own copyright and so they are not covered by this License. If you want to use, copy, or distribute these independent works, you need to find out what rights apply to these independent works and get permission to use them;

c. Factual information (the facts) are not covered by this License. Under most copyright laws, facts in themselves cannot be the subject of copyright (though their selection and arrangement can be). For example, while copyright might subsist in a work that describes factual information, the facts themselves are not covered. Because this License only covers rights that exist, it cannot license "facts" which do not;

d. Data protection rights are not covered; and

e. Data bases rights and copyright that do not belong to the Licensor are not covered.

2.4. **Relationship to Contents in the Database.** The individual items of the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights, including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database. For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of the rights over the images.

#### 3.0 Rights granted

3.1. **Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of any applicable copyright and Database Rights.** These rights explicitly include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in any medium and format whether now known or created in the future.

The rights granted cover, for example:

a. **Extraction and Re-utilization** of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents;

b. Creation of **Derivative Databases**;

c. Creation of **Collective Databases**;

d. **Temporary or permanent reproduction** by any means and in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and

e. **Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or performance** to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative Databases or as a part of Collective Databases.

3.2. **Compulsory license schemes.** For the avoidance of doubt:

a. **Non-waivable compulsory license schemes.** In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor hereby reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

b. **Waivable compulsory license schemes.** In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,

c. **Voluntary license schemes.** The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

3.3. **The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop distributing or making available the Database, is reserved.** Note that this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section 10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.

#### 4.0 Conditions of Use

4.1. The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to Your complying with the following conditions of use. These are important conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be in material breach of its terms.

4.2. **Notices.** If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You must:

a. Do so only under the terms of this License;

b. Include a copy of this License or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation;

c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices that refer to this License; and

d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to look for it.

4.3. **Notice for using output (Contents).** Creating and Using a Produced Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses, views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it is available under this License.

a. **Example notice.** The following text will satisfy notice under Section 4.3:

        Contains information from [NAME OF DATABASE] which is made available
        under the Open Database License (ODbL).

4.4. **Technological measures and additional terms**

a. **Application of Section 4.4.** This Section 4.4 applies to the Database, any Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database.

b. **Flexibility for implementation.** You may satisfy the requirements of Section 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Publicly Convey the Database, Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database.

#### 5.0 Moral rights

5.1. **Moral rights.** This section covers moral rights, including the right to be identified as the author of the Database and the right to object to treatment that would otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or any other derogatory treatment:

a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4;

b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1a in the relevant jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4; and

c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral rights under Section 5.1a and 5.1b, the author may retain their moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.

Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the work in some jurisdictions.

#### 6.0 Fair dealing, database exceptions, and other rights not affected

6.1. **This License does not affect rights that You may have under any applicable law,** including any exceptions and limitations to copyright or rights provided by fair dealing, fair use, database exceptions, or other applicable laws.

6.2. **Other rights not affected.** The rights granted by this License do not in any way affect, nor are they intended to affect, any of the following rights of a Person making use of the Database:

a. Rights to extraction and re-utilization insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including creating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the Contents, see Section 2.4);

b. Rights to use the Database, or an insubstantial part of the Contents, for the purposes of illustration, teaching, scientific research, or analysis;

c. Any other rights that may exist over the Contents independent of the rights granted in this License; and

d. Rights under applicable contract.

#### 7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer

7.1. **The Database is licensed by the Licensor "as is" and without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied.** This includes, but is not limited to, any implied warranties of merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, or non-infringement. In addition, the Licensor makes no warranties regarding:

a. The lawfulness of Your Use of the Database or any Derivative Database;

b. The completeness, currency, or accuracy of the Database; or

c. The safety or continued existence of the Database.

#### 8.0 Limitation of liability

8.1. **Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by the use of this Database, any Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, including without limitation:**

a. **Consequential, incidental, special, or indirect damages;**

b. **Any loss of profits, business, or opportunity;**

c. **Any loss of publicity or reputation;**  

d. **Any loss of privacy;**

e. **Loss or corruption of data;**

f. **Any other loss or damage.**

The exclusion of liability under this Section 8.1 applies even if the Licensor has been expressly advised of the possibility of such loss or damage.

#### 9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License

9.1. **Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without notice to You.** For the avoidance of doubt, termination does not affect the rights of others who may have received the Database, any Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You under this License; nor does it affect the rights of others who may have received Contents from a Database made available by You under this License that do not contain a substantial part of the Database on which the License continues as it regards the Database or Collective Database containing the Database.

9.2. **If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor will not terminate Your rights under it.**

9.3. **Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is perpetual** (subject to the duration of applicable copyright and Database Rights).

#### 10.0 General

10.1. **If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms and conditions of this License** and each remaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

10.2. **This License is the entire agreement between the parties** with respect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Database.

10.3. **If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be entitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any breach by the Licensor.**

10.4. **Choice of law.** This License takes effect in and will be governed by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant jurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the terms of this License.
